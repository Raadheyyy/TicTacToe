# TicTacToe
This is a Basic tictactoe game that I made in Python.
Initially Player "X" starts the game and asks for an input of the position and then it flips to Player "O" and asks again, this process continues until a player gets 3 position in a row, column or diagonal. If no one wins it displays it as a tie.
